1) When do you start QA process?
2) Can you define the format of a good test case?
3) Let’s say you found a bug in the app,  then it is fixed. How do you make sure that it doesn’t happen again?
4) Have you used any Automation tools for mobile apps?
5) You have an app with the following issues:
   * The app logo has a minor flow, the left corner is not visible.
   * When you tap on a certain button 5 times (exactly 5 times), the app crashes.
   * In the navigation map there is a 1 mile shift in all the pins and user’s location.
   * When you tap on the url’s, they don’t work.
       a) Can you say which ones are minor, which ones are major, which ones are blocker?
       b) There is a planned release tomorrow, which ones should be fixed? Define your approach.
