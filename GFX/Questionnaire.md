2.) What are some technical considerations to be aware of when developing shaders for a mobile platform with several hardware targets?
3.) A linear interpolation function lerp(a,b,t) is producing values outside of the range [a,b]. What is the problem?
4.) Your noise function is too expensive. How can you achieve cheap noise?
5.) How does MTKTextureLoader work?
6.) Why do we use kernels?
