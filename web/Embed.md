# Embeds

## Description

There is a unique way of embedding things, we have the old traditional way with an iframe and the instagram/twitter way using blockquotes

This challenge is unique, and is about re-creating a similar embed experience that Instagram provides. 
In a nutshell, you're supposed to create a javascript code that is responsible of replacing <blockquote> tags with an iframe dynamically. 

### Acceptance Criteria

* Embed a blockquote tag and have it get replaced dynamically by a js code snippet. 
* It should be dynamic, it should support passing width and height
* Support both landscape and portrait videos.
* We love React but at the end of the day, you should try to solve this with Javascript. 

#### Hints
* Look at how to communicate with iframe content to parent
* Look at how instagram does it
* Feel free to re-use one of our existing videos here: https://embed.lost.show/v3/17
